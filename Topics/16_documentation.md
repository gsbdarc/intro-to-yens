<a href="/" target="_blank">RCpedia</a> is a place to learn how to solve Research Computing tasks at Stanford GSB. Explore
<a href="/faqs" target="_blank">Frequently Asked Questions</a> for common questions and solutions as well as <a href="/topicGuides" target="_blank">Topic Guides</a> for more in-depth illustration of common research computing tasks. We are constantly adding to RCpedia!

If you do not see a page that you wish was on RCpedia and you think it would be beneficial to other users as well,
you can write your own (in Markdown) as a Topic Guide to contribute to RCpedia. When writing a topic guide, please develop
a full reproducible example with some context around the specific problem. 

Alternatively, you can suggest a topic guide page for us to write at [gsb_darcresearch@stanford.edu](mailto:gsb_darcresearch@stanford.edu)
or our <a href="https://circlerss.slack.com/archives/C01JXJ6U4E5" target="_blank">#gsb-yen-users Slack channel</a>.

Similarly, if you see an error or typo or something is unclear in the docs, kindly [let us know!](mailto:gsb_darcresearch@stanford.edu)
