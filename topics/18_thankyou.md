Congratulations! This concludes this "self-paced" Introduction to the Yens Course. Feel free to come back and repeat any 
part of the course and bookmark the <a href="https://gsbdarc.github.io/intro-to-yens" target="_blank">Getting Started Page</a>.

Check out the <a href="https://rcpedia.stanford.edu/training/index.html" target="_blank">Intermediate Yens</a> course to learn about Slurm, job arrays, GPU's and managing your python environments.


## Additional Computing Resources

- <a href="https://rcpedia.stanford.edu/yen/scheduler.html" target="_blank">Yen-Slurm</a>: A scheduled cluster of seven Linux computing servers (including a GPU node)  offered by the Stanford Graduate School of Business. It is designed to give researchers the ability to run computations that require a large amount of resources without leaving the environment and filesystem of the interactive Yens.
- <a href="https://rcpedia.stanford.edu/services/sherlock.html" target="_blank">Sherlock</a>: If you would like to take advantage of a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster built off of a resource scheduler system for your research, SRCC manages the <a href="https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Sherlock cluster</a>. We currently have reserved nodes for GSB research needs and if you are interested in learning more, please [contact us](mailto:gsb_darcresearch@stanford.edu).
- <a href="https://srcc.stanford.edu/farmshare2" target="_blank">Farmshare 2</a>: The Stanford Research Computing Center (SRCC) offers computing resources to the greater Stanford community. As a member of the university, 
you are welcome to use these resources and can directly contact SRCC for help or information at [srcc-support@stanford.edu](mailto:srcc-support@stanford.edu).
- <a href="https://rcpedia.stanford.edu/services/index.html" target="_blank">Other Infrastructure</a>: for less conventional tasks, like big data and cloud computing.
